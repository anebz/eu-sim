    st.sidebar.markdown('''This app lets you see the difference in the contextual embeddings from different sentences. You can experiment with a `main` sentence and sentences similar to it, and check how similar contextual embeddings actually are.
    \nI added a number of languages, classic word embeddings and I use [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/embeddings) for the contextual embeddings: `flair`, `ELMo` and `BERT`. 
    If you would like to see another language or if there is a bug or error, feel free to open [an issue on the repo](https://github.com/anebz/eu-sim/issues).
    \n### Info on contextualized embeddings
    \nWord embeddings are mappings from a word to a vector of numbers, designed to capture its meaning. The idea is that synonyms have very similar embeddings, antonyms have opposite embedding and so on.
    \nContextual embeddings obtain the word mapping based on its context, capturing uses of words across varied contexts and encoding knowledge that transfers across languages. 
    \nTo obtain the embedding of the whole sentence, I use [DocumentEmbedding](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/blob/master/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_5_DOCUMENT_EMBEDDINGS.md) from Flair to obtain a kind of average embedding of all the word embeddings in the sentence.
    \nFor more info, check out the [slides](https://github.com/anebz/eu-sim/blob/master/prev_data/semantic_search.pdf) of the talk I gave on the topic.
    \n### Findings
    \nFollowing my intuition, I expected that 'opposite' sentences would have 'opposite' embeddings. For example, `A invites B` is linguistically opposite to `B invites A`, or `A doesn't invite B`. I expected to see some difference in the embeddings.
    \nHowever, to my surprise all those sentences have very high embedding similarity. After doing the experiments, I concluded that this 'contrast' is very small compared to the fact that both sentences have many words in common, and this is what influences the embedding.
    \nThese are other things I found after experimenting with the embeddings:
    \n* As expected, word embeddings only capture individual words' meaning with no regard to context.
    \n* Sentences with the same subject and object have very similar embeddings, regardless of the verb or other parts of the sentence.
    \n* BERT embeddings don't seem to pay much attention to word order in the sentence, opposite to Flair and ELMo.
    \n* BERT embeddings are in general very very similar to the main sentence, even random sentences or sentences in other languages have a similarity of at least 70%. It is difficult to produce a sentence that produces a similarity of lower than 65%.
    \n\nFor more experiments and findings, check out the slides mentioned above. Feel free to chat with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aberasategi) about your experiments or findings! ðŸ˜„
